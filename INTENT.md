# Intent

`schema-next` is the new schema implementation.

Psyche intent:

*The schema-derived stack uses separate repositories for nota-next,
schema-next, and schema-rust-next rather than one combined integration
repository.*

*Macros lower schema positions into assembled schema. The lowering logic must
know where the node appeared; the same delimiter shape can mean different
things at different macro positions.*

*Schema macro expansion is structural matching over NOTA objects at macro
positions. The delimiter shape, number of contained objects, and symbol
qualification predicates select which macro variant lowers the object into
assembled schema.*

*Brace namespace and enum forms are sugar implemented as macros. A brace object
is a key/value map at the NOTA layer; when a schema position supplies the
surrounding type/field name, the brace body can lower to enum-like assembled
schema without repeating that name in the authored source.*

*Schema files are read as a known root struct. The top-level schema shape
supplies the root type name and field positions; inner variable vectors contain
macro objects that expand by position into assembled schema.*

*The NOTA delimiter pass emits a compact first-two-level structure header.
Schema lowering records that header before macro dispatch so textual schema
triage and binary signal-header triage follow the same structural idea.*

*Schema-created base enums define the reaction and action types for actor
input and output. Execution matches those generated variants to select replies,
route work, and drive signal/executor/SEMA behavior.*

*Schema files create the data types of the libraries they serve. Signal,
Nexus, SEMA, upgrade, and mail-event vocabularies should be declared as schema
objects first, then implemented as methods or traits on the generated Rust
nouns. Nexus is the execution-IO schema plane for internal effects, external
calls, and UI surfaces; it replaces the older executor wording in the runtime
triad.*

*Nexus owns in-flight mail state. Signal schemas describe what crosses the
wire, SEMA schemas describe durable state commands and replies, and Nexus
schemas describe the execution action that holds mail while it is being
processed between those two planes.*

This repository owns the schema macro engine and the ordered assembled schema
data model. It does not emit Rust source code.

Current implementation target:

- Macros are registered in `MacroRegistry`, including nested struct-field and
  enum-variant macros.
- The engine lowers root schema sections through the registry, not through
  hard-coded macro fields.
- A macro consumes a typed `MacroObject` at a `MacroPosition`; namespace
  declarations are pairs, while root sections are blocks.
- The context records which macros ran. Tests use that trace as the witness
  that Spirit schema lowering is really macro-dispatched.
