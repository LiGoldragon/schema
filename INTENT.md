# Intent

`schema-next` is the new schema implementation.

Psyche intent:

*The schema-derived stack uses separate repositories for nota-next,
schema-next, and schema-rust-next rather than one combined integration
repository.*

*Macros lower schema positions into assembled schema. The lowering logic must
know where the node appeared; the same delimiter shape can mean different
things at different macro positions.*

This repository owns the schema macro engine and the ordered assembled schema
data model. It does not emit Rust source code.
